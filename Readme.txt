== Description ==

Sell Object by Priced Unit or Allow your Customers to add Quantities/Measurement of Their Own with Measurement Price Calculator.

The Woocommerce Measurement Price Calculator Plugin for WooCommerce shops allows you to add and configure a calculator to your products that are sold in quantities based on their volume, length, area, square footage, or weight etc. This allows you to easily sell products which have a known measurement per item. For example, let’s assume you have room wallpaper that’s sold for $6.09 per square foot, and you offer room wallpaper only in square foot. And you allow user to enter their dimenssions, width and height in foots and the plugin can calculate total required square foot with total price.
